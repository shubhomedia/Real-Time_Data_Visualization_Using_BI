### Google Sites : [DIU BI](https://sites.google.com/diu.edu.bd/diubi/)
Data Analyzing to visualize is a process of improving the performance of business systems and achievement its goal also compete with others. Although a huge issue tocollect sequentially changes in data while rapidly changes customer needs. Moreover Balancing the Data collect demand with maintaining the storage using Data warehouse which is quite challenging. Therefore, we support the access for data collected instantly and more frequently with fastest ad hoc queries to be answered. Likewise, our model makes it happen to Analyze to visualization in quite a simple way. It’s a process of Input data collected from the user into an application transforming information into a visual form enabling the viewer to observe the downward trend and hike uptrend.However this model help to deliver on time and give the best output with various mediums such as Web View, Mobile or Desktop.Regarding this Model, it can give result in any circumstances investments occur. The user can experience an outstanding competences Business intelligence system which makes easier than others.
## Abstract
Day by day business has gone be more complicated and more competitive. Sales are the most valuable part of a business. Only the sales report of a business is not enough for today’s business development. The activity needs to get an insight into sales using data because of data-driven Decision is more impact. The purpose of the research is to develop an affordable and approachable model to deliver a business insight that helps you to understand your business and support to make business decisions faster. In this piece of research work, a model is proposed to develop an affordable simple sales data insight helping with business intelligence technique and cloud database. In terms of modern technology to control a vast amount of data for business decision-making process need to be more efficient. However to use a traditional database system business shrink to meet their real user's data. Against this backdrop, this Model through the research of Business intelligence Model of how to collect sales data fast and analysis with Power BI. Moreover, this model, elaborate on using business intelligence. This model uses a set of data, with ad Hoc query, Statistical analysis, some Mathematical Equation, and Data Visualization is a key component to gain a proactive and data-driven solution.

## Basic Algorithm of Proposed Model
1.  - START Input With Mobile Application
2.  - If Internet Not Connected, Data Saved on Local Database
3. - Internet Connected, Data Sync with Firebase Database
4. - API Called, Data Parse from Firebase
5. - Data Input to Microsoft Power BI
6. - Power BI, Output Visualized Data. 

## Data Relations Tables

## Equations :
To archive goal and mining the right information model used some equation that’s are :
> Total Sales = [Sales Price] * [Total Unit]

In Power Query mode of power bi, there is a new column added and it’s Total Sales which is multiplying of Sale Price column and Total Unit column.
> Cost = [Cost Price] * [Total Unit]

Cost Column is a result of multiplying cost price column and total unit column.
> Gross Profit = [Total Sales] – [Cost]

Gross Profit is a profit that when total sales subtract by cost.
> Gross Profit % = SUM (Sales [Gross Profit]) / SUM (Sales [Total Sales])

Where Gross profit percent represents the sum of gross profit divided by totals sales

## Conclusion
In conclusion, BI has a big impact on the IT industry. Every corporate organization who manages insights into their data, strategies, profits, and performances thus BI help them to make significant and complex decisions. This paper represents important facts about data collection, storage, process, and visualization output. The main solution mainly based on power BI insight where table relationship and data-driven culture by enabling everyone to turn data into insightful visualizations they can use to make business decisions quickly and confidently.
